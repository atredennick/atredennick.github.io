Our new [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13098) -- a collaborative effort of several USU Wildland Resources and Ecology Center researchers, led by Peter Adler -- shows that the preponderance of evidence from published studies suggests that intraspecific competition is greater than interspecific competition in terrestrial plant communities. This is a key ingredient for stable coexistence, but empirical evidence for this theoretical necessity was previously found to be weak. Our analysis resolves a longstanding mismatch between theory and data, and shows that mechanisms that promote coexistence at local scales are common.
