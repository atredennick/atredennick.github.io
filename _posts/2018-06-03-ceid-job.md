I'm very excited to join the [Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases](http://ceid.uga.edu/) within the [Odum School of Ecology](http://www.ecology.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia. I'll be working with [Dr. John Drake](https://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/drakelab/) to anticipate the (re)emergence of human infectious diseases using statistical early warning signals.
