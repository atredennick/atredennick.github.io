title: New paper - hierarchical drivers of ecosystem stability in metacommunities
author: andrew

New paper representing a large collaboration led by [Kevin Wilcox](https://kevinwilcox.weebly.com/) and myself where we use the [CoRRE database](https://corredata.weebly.com/) to partition the variance of metacommunity ecosystem stability among community-level stability and community asynchrony. We found that community asynchrony is important and that, at least at the scales we looked at, the degree of community synchrony was driven by the degree of metapopulation synchrony, not species turnover in space. It's open access, so anyone can read it [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12861/full).
