A new paper led by Adam Clark on predicting species' abundances in a biodiversity experiment is now [online at Journal of Ecology](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.13316). Our main question was, "To predict a species' abundance in mixture, how well-resolved do species interactions need to be reperesented in the model?" In general, we found that species interactions were important for getting predictions right, but we did not need to model each pairwise (or higher order) interaction. Instead, a pooled effect of all interspecific competition seemed to do the trick.
