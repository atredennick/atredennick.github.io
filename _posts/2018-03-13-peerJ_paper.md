We performed a five year precipitation manipulation experiment (plus or minus 50\% intercepted rainfall) at the US Sheep Experimental Station in Idaho to see how forecasts of changing precipitation might impact ecosystem functioning. While annual net primary productivity (ANPP) was slightly higher in irrigation plots and slightly lower in drought plots, the underlying relationship between soil moisture and ANPP was weak and consistent across treatments. This leads us to conclude that the dominant species at our study site have developed bet-hedging strategies where responses to changes in environmental conditions are weak.
