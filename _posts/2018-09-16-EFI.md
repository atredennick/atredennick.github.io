I'm proud to announce that the [Ecological Forecasting Initiative](https://ecoforecast.org/), of which I am founding member, is now live!
Our mission is to solve the challenge of predicting nature.

>The Ecological Forecasting Initiative is a grassroots consortium aimed at building and supporting an interdisciplinary community of practice around near-term (daily to decadal) ecological forecasts.
