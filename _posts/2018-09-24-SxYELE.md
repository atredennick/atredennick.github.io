Our **Ideas and Perspectives** paper on size-by-environment interactions in fluctuating environments is now [online at Ecology Letters](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.13154). In the paper, we introduce size-by-environment interactions as a new way that species can cope with or exploit environmental variation through time. We tested the idea with data from 15 plant populations and subsequent simulations using integral projection models. We found that size-by-environment interactions were common, but they had little impact on population dynamics in our focal species. We discuss the ingredients necessary for size-by-environment interactions to be important for population dynamics.
