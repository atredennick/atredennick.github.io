# How to apply?

If you are interested in theoretical approaches to community ecology and
biogeography, want to work in a dynamic department, and are not afraid
of inter-disciplinary approaches, then we offer a research environment
where you will be able to pursue your scientific interests and learn new
skills.

Before you apply, please have a look at some of our
[publications](/papers/). The one with a little star next to them are the most
representative of our core scientific interests. Knowledge of mathematics
or programming is always a good thing, but being genuinely willing to learn
is far more important. Remember that we are an ecology lab -- we love using
and building tools, but the questions we ask matter more.

To apply, send Timoth√©e (`timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca`) a single PDF
with your CV, a one-page summary of your career aspirations and outline of
your motivation and past research experience, and contact information of
two references.
