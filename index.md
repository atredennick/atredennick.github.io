I am a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in Biology and Mathematics working with [Peter Adler](https://qcnr.usu.edu/labs/adler_lab/) at Utah State University and [Fred Adler](http://www.math.utah.edu/~adler/) at the University of Utah. I use dynamic population models and long term data sets to understand the drivers of stability in natural communities and to forecast the impacts of climate change on plant populations.
