I am a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in Biology and Mathematics working with [Peter Adler](https://qcnr.usu.edu/labs/adler_lab/) at Utah State University and [Fred Adler](http://www.math.utah.edu/~adler/) at the University of Utah. My research seeks to understand the causes and consequences of biodiversity and to predict the impacts of climate change on plant populations.
