Biodiversity data can be difficult to deal with. There is a lot of it, and
it is stored all over the place in a variety of formats that don't interact
very well. We are experienced in managing, cleaning, and analysing this type
of data. We can help you

- design a data management plan for biodiversity/environmental data
- develop tools to manage and visualize data
- store and serve large volume of biodiversity data
- integrate your data with open databases and predictive models

We operate a cyberinfrastructure for quantitative ecology, funded by the
Québec government and the [Canadian Foundation for Innovation][cfi], and
managed in part by [Compute Québec][cq]. This gives us access to computing
resources, visualization platforms for GIS and other large-scale data,
and high-performance, secure, backed-up storage for sensitive data.
